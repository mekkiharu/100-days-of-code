# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1: The Nature of Props

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

I have learned the nature of Props and the interesting ways of handling them.

_Notes_

Apparently `props` can be summed up in a simple way, _the property of the component, the `key`_ of the object/string/component/whatever we want to pass onto the component to be handled whichever way it suits the application.

I found it interesting that we can pass _an entire component_ as a prop _for another component_. It may still require some experimentations on my end. but I wonder if we can properly pass states on the components properly, creating some sort of hierarchy between them.

## Day 2: The Lifecycle

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

I have learned proper State Handling and implementation of Component Lifecycles.

## Day 3: Joi to the World

### Stack: Node and Express

### Type: [Documentation](https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

**Progress:**

I have gleaned an understanding of Joi and Server-Side Validation

## Day 4: (not) Hooked by Typescript

### Stack: React JS, Typescript

### Type: [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

**Progress:**

I have understood some basic concepts regarding Hooks, and possibly Typescript.

**Notes**

Hooks feels truly clunky as I am still unfamiliar. Regardless, I can see how it can make management of states, lifecycles and various more React goodies much better. Though I still can't differentiate when to use Classes and when to use Hooks excluding projects that _dont_ have hooks.

## Day 5: Joins

### Stack: MySQL

### Type: [Documentation](https://www.guru99.com/joins.html)

**Progress:**

I have somewhat furthered my understanding of Joins

## Day 6: Reduced

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Redux is hella confusing.

**Notes**

Needs more research and examples to further understand.

## Day 1 (week 2): Components and States

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Set aside Redux for some time and re-learned state rules, functional and class-based components.

**Notes**

States are pieces of `data` within a component that can be shared through the usage of the `props` system. The `data` within a State is shared across all instances and when the `data` updates, all components that makes use of the State is forcefulle re-rendered.

Functional Components are components best used for rendering simple content. Unlike Class-Based components, Functional Components cannot normally use the State system unless one uses Hooks.  
Class-based Components on the other hand, can be seen as the _full package_. It requires a render method to handle all the components and data to be rendered, and a constructor function inherited from `React.Component` for initializing States and various javascript goodies. Class-based components usually have multiple functions and employs the usage of Lifecycle methods.

## Day 2 (week 2): DefaultProps and Re-usable Components

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Learned how to properly setup a default prop for components, and how to handle re-usable components.

**Notes**

The proper way for setting up a default Prop for a component is with `<componentName>.defaultProp{<objectName>: <objectData>}`. It's a rather useful method of setting those up.
Re-usable components should really have organized helper functions to help make sense of what's doing what. Also note that Spinners (loading thingies) is going to be handy for doing _many_ things and it's best as a re-usable component for easy importing. Also take note that using Class-based Components makes for really better organization of these codes.
