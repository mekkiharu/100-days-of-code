# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1: The Nature of Props

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

I have learned the nature of Props and the interesting ways of handling them.

_Notes_

Apparently `props` can be summed up in a simple way, _the property of the component, the `key`_ of the object/string/component/whatever we want to pass onto the component to be handled whichever way it suits the application.

I found it interesting that we can pass _an entire component_ as a prop _for another component_. It may still require some experimentations on my end. but I wonder if we can properly pass states on the components properly, creating some sort of hierarchy between them.

## Day 2: The Lifecycle

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

I have learned proper State Handling and implementation of Component Lifecycles.

## Day 3: Joi to the World

### Stack: Node and Express

### Type: [Documentation](https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

**Progress:**

I have gleaned an understanding of Joi and Server-Side Validation

## Day 4: (not) Hooked by Typescript

### Stack: React JS, Typescript

### Type: [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

**Progress:**

I have understood some basic concepts regarding Hooks, and possibly Typescript.

**Notes**

Hooks feels truly clunky as I am still unfamiliar. Regardless, I can see how it can make management of states, lifecycles and various more React goodies much better. Though I still can't differentiate when to use Classes and when to use Hooks excluding projects that _dont_ have hooks.

## Day 5: Joins

### Stack: MySQL

### Type: [Documentation](https://www.guru99.com/joins.html)

**Progress:**

I have somewhat furthered my understanding of Joins

## Day 6: Reduced

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Redux is hella confusing.

**Notes**

Needs more research and examples to further understand.

## Day 1 (week 2): Components and States

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Set aside Redux for some time and re-learned state rules, functional and class-based components.

**Notes**

States are pieces of `data` within a component that can be shared through the usage of the `props` system. The `data` within a State is shared across all instances and when the `data` updates, all components that makes use of the State is forcefulle re-rendered.

Functional Components are components best used for rendering simple content. Unlike Class-Based components, Functional Components cannot normally use the State system unless one uses Hooks.  
Class-based Components on the other hand, can be seen as the _full package_. It requires a render method to handle all the components and data to be rendered, and a constructor function inherited from `React.Component` for initializing States and various javascript goodies. Class-based components usually have multiple functions and employs the usage of Lifecycle methods.

## Day 2 (week 2): DefaultProps and Re-usable Components

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

Learned how to properly setup a default prop for components, and how to handle re-usable components.

**Notes**

The proper way for setting up a default Prop for a component is with `<componentName>.defaultProp{<objectName>: <objectData>}`. It's a rather useful method of setting those up.
Re-usable components should really have organized helper functions to help make sense of what's doing what. Also note that Spinners (loading thingies) is going to be handy for doing _many_ things and it's best as a re-usable component for easy importing. Also take note that using Class-based Components makes for really better organization of these codes.

## Day 3 (Week 2):

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

Re-viewed basics of handling user input and forms.

## Day 4 (Week 2):

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

Reviewed handling of Forms, API Requests and functionalities

## Day 5 (Week 2): This Parents and Childrens

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

Reviewed the purpose of `this` in javascript context and learned the new ways of communicating child components and parent components

**Notes**

the value of `this` is determined by the current instance of said object.

- example: meow = new Cat(); meow.setCatSound("moewww"); meow.catSound();

`class Cat() {

        setCatSound(sound) {
            this.sound = sound
        }

        catSound() {
            return this.sound;
        }
    }`

in this instance of meow, `this` will refer to the values set by the instance `meow`

## Day 6 (Week 2): Awaiting Grids and Fr

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

Reviewed async handling of Axios requests, solving some `this` problems by using arrow functions, reviewed Grid layout and Fr

**Notes**

the unit `fr` is used to make columns take an equal amount of space. 1fr is equivalent to 1 part of available space in a grid. Usually used for setting up columns.

## Day 1 (Week 3)

### Stack: HTML & CSS

### Type: [Responsive Web Design](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/reponsive-web-design/)

**Progress**

Reviewed basics of HTML5 & CSS

**Notes**

`Radio Buttons` should have a `for` attribute on their parent Label that matches the `name` attribute on their own input tag to make it easier for Assistive techonologies to categorize them. The same principle also applies to `Checkboxes`.

It's good practice to end your styles with `;` (semi-colon).

`Classes` can be re-used as often as you prefer while `ID` can only be used on a single element.

`Padding` controls the amount of space between the element's content and its `border`.

`Margin` controls the amount of space between an element's `border` and surrounding elements.

`Padding` Sides: Top, Right, Bottom, Left. This is called `Clockwise Notation`

`css [attr='value']` can be used to select all elements with a specific `attribute` that has a certain `value`. E.g. `css [type='meow']`

`Absoulte vs. Relative units`

`Absoulute` units try to approximate real world units of measurement like `in` and `mm` on a screen. The view can vary depending on screen resolution.

`Relative` units are relative to another length value. For example, `em` is relative to the parent's font-size. In which case, `X` font-size is equivalent to `1em`

In CSS, the second declaration will always take precedence over the previous ones.

## Day 2 (Week 3): Grid Ends and References

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

I learned the `React.createRef()` feature and manipulation of grids.

**Notes**

`React.createRef()` lets you access a specific element in the real DOM. Its vanilla javascript equivalent is `document.querySelector()`.
From there, the `reference` created can then be examined to pull out any information we might need for usage.

`grid-row-end` is given the value of `span n` where `n` is a number to pass usually meant for adjusting `height` of the data inside the cell. The `span` allocates the amount of cells needed to properly render the data.
