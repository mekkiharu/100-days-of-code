# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1: The Nature of Props

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress:**

I have learned the nature of Props and the interesting ways of handling them.

_Notes_

Apparently `props` can be summed up in a simple way, _the property of the component, the `key`_ of the object/string/component/whatever we want to pass onto the component to be handled whichever way it suits the application.

I found it interesting that we can pass _an entire component_ as a prop _for another component_. It may still require some experimentations on my end. but I wonder if we can properly pass states on the components properly, creating some sort of hierarchy between them.

## Day 2: The Lifecycle

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**

I have learned proper State Handling and implementation of Component Lifecycles.


## Day 3: Joi to the World

### Stack: Node and Express

### Type: [Documentation] (https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

**Progress:** 

I have gleaned an understanding of Joi and Server-Side Validation


## Day 4: (not) Hooked by Typescript

### Stack: React JS, Typescript

### Type: [React] (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) [Typescript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

**Progress:**

I have understood some basic concepts regarding Hooks, and possibly Typescript. 

__Notes__

Hooks feels truly clunky as I am still unfamiliar. Regardless, I can see how it can make management of states, lifecycles and various more React goodies much better. Though I still can't differentiate when to use Classes and when to use Hooks excluding projects that *dont* have hooks.


## Day 5: Joins

### Stack: MySQL

### Type: [Documentation] (https://www.guru99.com/joins.html)

**Progress:**

I have somewhat furthered my understanding of Joins

## Day 6: Reduced

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course] (https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**
Redux is hella confusing.

__Notes__

Needs more research and examples to further understand.
