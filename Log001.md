## Day 1: The Nature of Props

### Stack: React JS

### Type: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

**Progress**
I have learned the nature of Props and the interesting ways of handling them.

_Notes_
Apparently `props` can be summed up in a simple way, _the property of the component, the `key`_ of the object/string/component/whatever we want to pass onto the component to be handled whichever way it suits the application.
I found it interesting that we can pass _an entire component_ as a prop _for another component_. It may still require some experimentations on my end. but I wonder if we can properly pass states on the components properly, creating some sort of hierarchy between them.
